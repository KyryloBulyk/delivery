## Features
- User authentication and authorization via JWT Tokens
- Secure API endpoints
- CRUD operations for User, Product, Order, Cart, and Categories
- PostgreSQL integration for data persistence
- Real-time data updates (where applicable)
- Comprehensive unit tests for Services
- Integration tests for all Controllers
- H2 Database usage for Integration Tests

## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17
- Maven
- PostgreSQL

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KyryloBulyk/delivery.git
    ```

    cd delivery
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```


## Database Installation Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the `deliverydb.sql` database locally using PostgreSQL.

### Installation Steps

1. **Open the PostgreSQL Command Line Tool**:
   - On Windows, search for `psql` in the Start menu.
   - On MacOS or Linux, open a terminal and type `psql`.

2. **Log in to PostgreSQL**:
   - Use the following command, replacing `[username]` with your PostgreSQL username:
     ```bash
     psql -U [username]
     ```

3. **Create the Database**:
   - Run the following SQL command to create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE deliverydb;
     ```

4. **Exit psql**:
   - Type `\q` and hit Enter to exit.

5. **Import the SQL File**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing `deliverydb.sql`.
   - Run the command below, replacing `[username]` with your PostgreSQL username:
     ```bash
     psql -U [username] -d deliverydb -f deliverydb.sql
     ```

6. **Verify the Import**:
   - Log back into PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     psql -U [username] deliverydb
     ```
   - Check if tables and data are imported correctly:
     ```sql
     \dt
     ```

7. **Start Using the Database**:
   - Update the `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` fields in `application.properties` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, refer to PostgreSQL documentation or the error messages provided by the command line for guidance.
